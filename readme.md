# Calico Open Source 3.30: Kubernetes Network Policy Management Workshop

## Welcome

In this Calico Open Source focused workshop, you will work with Calico, Calico Whisker, and Calico Cloud Free Tier to learn how implement network security for workloads to reduce the attack surface of applications.  

Cloud-native applications require a modern approach based on the zero-trust principles of identity-based access, least privilege access, and proactively detecting threats and reducing the blast radius in case of a breach.

Calico enables fine-grained, secure workload access controls between your microservices and external databases, cloud services, APIs, and other applications. It also prevents the lateral movement of threats with identity-aware segmentation that works across all of your workload environments, including hosts, VMs, Kubernetes components, and services.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications with Calico, along with best practices that you can implement in your organization.

### Time Requirements

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 60-90 minutes.
